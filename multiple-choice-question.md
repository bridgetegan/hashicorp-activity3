Terraform has several built-in commands for reading files: `file`, `filebase64`, `fileexists`, and `templatefile`. A developer needs to read some input from a local file called `id_rsa.pub` that resides in the same directory as the configuration used to import the fileâ€™s contents as a string. Which built-in Terraform command should the developer use based on this input?
